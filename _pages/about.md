ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I am Jiale Han. I am now a post-doctoral fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. [Yi Yang](https://yya518.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. degree from BUPT in 2023 and my Bachelor degree from Xidian University in 2018. 

I am broadly interested in natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and their applications in the finance and business domain. My research focuses on developing effective and efficient techniques for representing and reasoning about semantic and structural information in plain text and structured graphs. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in any discussions and collaborations!

Here are my [Research](https://hanjiale.github.io/research/), [Publications](https://hanjiale.github.io/publications/), and [CV](https://hanjiale.github.io/cv/).
