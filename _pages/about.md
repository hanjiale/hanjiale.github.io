ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My current research focuses on natural language processing (NLP), information extraction, question answering, and LLM reasoning. 
I received my Ph.D. degree from BUPT in 2023. During my Ph.D., I visited [StatNLP](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei) as a visiting research fellow at SUTD.
Before that, I received my Bachelor degree from Xidian University in 2018.

Here are my [CV](https://hanjiale.github.io/cv/) and [Publications](https://hanjiale.github.io/publications/).
