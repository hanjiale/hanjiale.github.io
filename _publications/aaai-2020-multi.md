Multi-hop question answering models based on knowledge graph have been extensively studied. Most existing models predict a single answer with the highest probability by ranking candidate answers. However, they are stuck in predicting all the right answers caused by the ranking method. In this paper, we propose a novel model that converts the ranking of candidate answers into individual predictions for each candidate, named heterogeneous knowledge graph based multi-hop and multi-answer model (HGMAN). HGMAN is capable of capturing more informative representations for relations assisted by our heterogeneous graph, which consists of multiple entity nodes and relation nodes. We rely on graph convolutional network for multi-hop reasoning and then binary classification for each node to get multiple answers. Experimental results on MetaQA dataset show the performance of our proposed model over all baselines.
